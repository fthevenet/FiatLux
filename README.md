# Fiat Lux
A (very old) Lightwave 3D Object viewer

This code is:
* Very old (last changes in 2000)
* Pretty poorly written
* Using tools and technologies that are quite obsolete by now (MsVC++ 6.0, MFC, OpenGL)
* Probably of no practical use to anyone, anymore
* Uploaded here for archiving purposes (and mostly out of nostalgia, tbh)

Yet, amazingly enough, the binary still works just fine 20+ years latter on Windows 10 and current PC hardware (and *damn*, that thing runs *fast*!)
